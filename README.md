Sure, here's a guide in markdown format on how to clone your repository, set up your Docker container, and host it with ngrok:

```markdown
# Guide to Clone Repository, Set Up Docker Container, and Host with Ngrok

## Prerequisites
- Git
- Docker
- Ngrok

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone your repository. Then run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GooseSAndboxx/MyNewRepository
```

## Step 2: Build the Docker Image
Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile (this should be the `MyNewRepository` directory if you followed the previous step). Then run the following command to build your Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t my-app .
```
Replace `my-app` with the name you want to give your Docker image.

## Step 3: Run the Docker Container
Start your Docker container with the following command:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-app
```
This will start your application and make it accessible at `localhost:5000`.

## Step 4: Install and Start Ngrok
In a new terminal window, navigate to the directory where you installed ngrok and run the following command:
```bash
./ngrok http 5000
```
This will start ngrok, which will create a secure tunnel to your localhost at port 5000.

## Step 5: Access Your Application
You should see a line in the ngrok output that looks something like this:
```bash
Forwarding                    http://<random-subdomain>.ngrok.io -> localhost:5000
```
You can access your application from anywhere using the `http://<random-subdomain>.ngrok.io` URL. Replace `<random-subdomain>` with the actual subdomain provided by ngrok.
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
